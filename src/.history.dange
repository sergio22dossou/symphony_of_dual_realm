In an intricate universe woven with mysteries and unsuspected powers,two realities coexisted in harmony and conflict,
weaving the threads of destiny for both gods and humans.
Every flutter of a god's wings had the power to unleash a storm in the human world. 
Every divine smile could warm mortal hearts, and every tear shed by a god had the power to nurture the fields of human life.
At the heart of this cosmic symphony stood Marques, a being of dazzling rarity,
half man and half god, a demigod whose life was interwoven between the divine and earthly realms.
Marques worked as a slave in the service of Azaka Medeh, the benevolent god of agriculture.
Marques' fingers plunged into fertile soil, each plant he tended, each tree he pruned, every flower
he bathed in his care contributed to the
prosperity of harvests and the sustenance of humans.
Azaka Medeh had crafted a resplendent garden, a treasure trove of greenery and life,every vibrant aspect of which
influenced the human lands. Each blossoming flower in the garden was like a newborn star in the gods' sky, and every
ripening fruit turned into a sweet gift for mortals.
Marques' devotion to his work was such that human fields flourished like jewels scattered by divine winds.
However, a dark day enveloped the realm, a sinister cloud no one had foreseen. A virus,
born from the depths of Azaka Medeh's field,
began to spread, feasting on the dreams and hopes of both worlds.
Human harvests withered, trees became sterile, and smiles faded. The kingdom faltered under the weight of the curse,
and hearts were shrouded in darkness.
Marques, the demigod with a heart of courage and determination, refused to submit to this dire fate.
His quest for emancipation intensified, a glimmer of hope amidst the growing shadows.
Guided by his unique connection to the earth and his unyielding will, Marques embarked on a daring
journey across worlds, uncovering buried secrets
and encountering astonishing beings who aided him in deciphering the virus' enigma.
